## Description

The "Programming Language Suggestor" is a web application that helps users find a suitable programming language based on their preferences. Users input information about their age, education level, dietary choices, preferred snack, and energy levels. The application then analyzes these inputs and provides a recommendation for a programming language that may be a good fit for them.

This project is a simple example of a decision-making application and demonstrates how JavaScript can be used to process user input and generate a result.
